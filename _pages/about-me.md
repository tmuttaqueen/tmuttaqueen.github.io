## Undergraduate
I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology 
(BUET). In my undergraduate year I have been involved in programming contests. Solved more than 2000 data structure and 
algorithm based problems in various online judges. Mostly I used C++ for contests. My team (BUET_Bloodhound) had the 
honor to participate in ICPC World Final, 2019 in Porto, Portugal.

## Thesis
In the final year of my undergrad I did my thesis on Code Translation. It is a sequence to sequence modeling task, 
given a code generate it's natural language description. I developed a large dataset (4.2 Million code-nl pair) for this 
task and fine tuned it for better accuracy. The outcome of my work, 
["CoDesc: A Large Codeâ€“Description Parallel Dataset"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/CoDesc.pdf)
published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2021.

## Work
After graduating from BUET in February, 2021. I have joined a startup in Dhaka, Bangladesh named PriyoSys Ltd. Here I have 
worked in Django, Python, PostgreSQL stack. Used an agile approach to develop software and implementing 
new features and improvements to the existing projects. Worked on Nearby News recommender system deployed it in AWS Lambda and used
Python and AWS DynamoDB in the backend. Then worked mostly on another bidding project similar to eBay named [sowda.com](https://sowda.com). Here worked on 3rd party seller integration, order payment and delivery system. Used Celery and Redis in the backend for bid request processing. For database used postgres. Also worked on some other projects for a small time, [priyo.org](https://priyo.org/) and priyo serverside payment method integration ( bKash, Nagad, DBBL, Paypal etc. ).


After woking seven month's here, I joined another local company in Bangladesh named TigerIT Limited. Here I am working on deep learning based face recognition pipeline. My current task is making face detection and allignment faster with lowest accuracy lost and make the model production ready by converting it C++ using onnx and write some additional API's on top.
