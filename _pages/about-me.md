## Undergraduate
I started my B.Sc. from Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in February, 2016, graduated in February, 2021. This was a very transitioning time for me, met a lot of smart people. If I had to say which time of my life I enjoyed most and was growing rapidly, I must say my university life. We were hit by covid in 2020, then classes were closed for almost months. Then rest of my undergrad was basically online class. I wish we weren't hit by covid :')


In my undergraduate year I have been deeply involved in programming contests. My team (BUET_Bloodhound) had the honor to participate in ICPC World Final, 2019 in Porto, Portugal.

In the final year of my undergrad I did my thesis on Code Translation. It is a sequence to sequence modeling task, given a code generate it's natural language description. I developed a large dataset (4.2 Million code-nl pair) for this task and fine tuned it for better accuracy. The outcome of my work, 
["CoDesc: A Large Codeâ€“Description Parallel Dataset"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/CoDesc.pdf) published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2021.

## Work
After graduating from BUET in February, 2021. I have joined a startup in Dhaka, Bangladesh named PriyoSys Ltd. Here I have worked in Django, Python, PostgreSQL stack. Used an agile approach to develop software and implementing new features and improvements to the existing projects. It was a startup, which had a lot of visionary projects, but not enough effort to gain customers and customer retention. Thus from the development perspective, did a lot of coding and creating new projects. Learnt a lot, I believe as a fresher with zero experience in industry this experience helped me bootstrapping my hunger for developing some more complicated and scalable systems.


Soon, I felt the lack of satisfaction of scaling a product from zero customers to millions of customers as we kept deprecating projects and creating new ones. Found another opportunity in another company in Dhaka, Bangladesh named TigerIT Limited. It had govt. contract for National ID card verification, passport etc via fingerprint and facial image. Thinking about the impact of my work and more monetary incentive, took that offer to work on their facial recognition system. The problem statement they were facing was that if they make the detection accuracy better, the model runs slow. So, I had to explore various SOTA models and explore various input/output modifications which can give us enough accuracy with less runtime. This was an exciting problem to solve with huge impact.

Since I graduated from BUET, I had the dream of working in a Large company which have products used by all over the world. I was mainly applying to Google, Meta and Amazon. One month after joining TigerIT, I had the phone call with a Google recruiter where they wanted to interview me for an L3 Software Engineer position. I was so excited about the opportunity! Soon they scheduled one phone interview, after that five onsite interview (which are taken online btw xD). Their hiring process took sometime and got my offer letter after one long month for a software position in Google Global Network. The problem statement we are trying to solve here is very interesting, how can we build the infrstracture so that operation can repair any network fault fast enough and maintain SLO, and when can we automate the whole repair process without human involvement. I am working in the alerting pipeline (getting the telemetry data and creating alerts in case of network fault), some part of the repair orchestration and vendor engagement.
