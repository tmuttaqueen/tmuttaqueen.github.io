## Undergraduate
I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology 
(BUET). In my undergraduate year I have been involved in programming contests. Solved more than 2000 data structure and 
algorithm based problems in various online judges. Mostly I used C++ for contests. My team (BUET_Bloodhound) had the 
honor to participate in ICPC World Final, 2019 in Porto, Portugal.

## Thesis
In the final year of my undergrad I did my thesis on Code Translation. It is a sequence to sequence modeling task, 
given a code generate it's natural language description. I developed a large dataset (4.2 Million code-nl pair) for this 
task and fine tuned it for better accuracy. The outcome of my work, 
["CoDesc: A Large Codeâ€“Description Parallel Dataset"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/CoDesc.pdf)
published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2021.
