After a long break, I'm pumped to be bringing back my old website. In April 2022, I made the move to Dublin, Ireland, to start my new career at Google. The past two years have been a wild ride, but I'm ready to get back on track and share my latest thoughts here.


How was life? I moved to a whole new country, made new friends, and started a dream job at Google. Google is like a whole other universe compared to my previous companies â€“ their tools and systems are on a whole different level. It took me a while to get my bearings, but the learning curve has been totally worth it. Learnt a lot about distributed systems and collaborating with people of different roles and timezones. In the process, I've had to put a lot of things on hold, like solving programming contests problems and learning new tech skills that are not directly needed for my day to day job at this moment (like machine learning and web development). I was so focused on my job and learning that I didn't have time for anything else. In October 2023, I even got promoted from L3 to L4!


This year, I'm focusing on more than the 9-to-5 grind and expanding my breadth of knowledge beyond my day to day job. While I'll be sharing some of my newfound knowledge on this site, I'll keep things light on the technical jargon. Those in-depth explanations take a ton of time to craft and require a lot of focus from readers. Also, I'm pretty smitten with this Jekyll-based static site generator, so I'm sticking with it for now.


How were the things not related to my job? Life outside of work has been a whirlwind of new experiences, new friends, and new hobbies. I've been diving into activities like bouldering, boxing, and regular gym sessions. But my 2024 got off to a rocky start with a minor accident during a bouldering session. I ended up with two fractures in my elbow, but thankfully, I'm on the mend and should be fully recovered in a few weeks. ðŸ’ª

That's it for now!
