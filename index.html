                I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering
                from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). In my undergraduate
                year I have been involved in programming contests. Solved more than 2000 data structure and algorithm based
                problems in various online judges. Mostly I used C++ for contests. My team (BUET_Bloodhound) had the honor
                to participate in ICPC World Final, 2019 in Porto, Portugal.

                In the final year of my undergrad I did my thesis on Code Translation. It is a sequence to sequence modeling
                task, given a code generate it's natural language description. I developed a large dataset
                (4.2 Million code-nl pair) for this task and
                fine tuned it for better accuracy. The outcome of my work, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/CoDesc.pdf">"CoDesc: A Large Codeâ€“Description
                Parallel Dataset"</a> published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2021.

                After graduating from BUET in February, 2021. I have joined a startup in Dhaka, Bangladesh named PriyoSys Ltd.
               Here I am working in Django, Python, PostgreSQL stack. Currently I am using an agile approach to develop software
               and implementing new features and improvements to existing projects. My work details can be found <a href="#">
